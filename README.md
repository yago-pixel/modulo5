Welcome to your Work Day Scheduler.
Here you can save all your events and appointments for your work day in the standard business hours.
This project deepened my knowledge on how to apply third-party APIs to your dynamic webpage.
Enjoy using this web app to save your important events for your workday!

The colors of the time blocks show you which events are in the past: grey, present: red, and future: green.

In those you can also enter your events or appointments for each time block.
